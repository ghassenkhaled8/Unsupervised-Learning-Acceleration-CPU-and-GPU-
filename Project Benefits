Refactoring Workloads
Data exploration is a vital part of Data Science Workflows:
Understanding, cleaning, manipulating data
Consistent data types, formats and filling in gaps
Reiterating to add features
Pandas: Functions developed with vectorized operations for top-speed computations
But they are CPU-constrained, therefore, tasks are very time consuming
RAPIDS: Much faster Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) tasks
